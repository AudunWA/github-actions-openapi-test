# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
  # Every 
  - cron:  '0 * * * *'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

      steps:

        # Checkout your code
        - name: Checkout

        # Generate your OpenAPI document (if you don't write it manually)

        # Use the action to generate a client package
        # This uses the default path for the openapi document and thus assumes there is an openapi.json in the current workspace.
